# KC-Crime-Project

Kansas City is a moderately sized metropolitan area of just over 2 million people, situated on the Kansas-Missouri border. It is a very nice place to live with a lot of benefits. Being a more recent resident of Kansas City, I was surprised when consistently hearing about homicides in the area. As of mid-summer, there have been 104 in 2019 alone. I want to understand this current situation better, and have designed this project to look at violent crime in Kansas City, Missouri. 

The data that will be used are from Open Data KC, which publishes a lot of different datasets relating to the city. I will be using police reports from 2016-2018. This project has a lot of possibilities, and will be a work in progress over the next several months. 

While relying on my background in Economics and Sociology, this project will also demonstrate my skills in:

 - Using Python Pandas to manipulate and create features data
 - Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and guide my analysis
 - Leveraging simple statistics to look for correlations and test hypotheses 
 - Applying more complicated machine learning techniques project trends into the future
